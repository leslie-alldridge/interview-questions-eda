# A brainstorm of interview blockers

## Before applying

As tough or awkward as it may be, send your CV and cover letter example to 2-3 friends for feedback. You don't need to implement everything they suggest, but at least ask why and understand their point of view. 

Personally I was hesitant to share it with friends and colleagues, but after seeing the value it provides, this is now part of my job application ritual. Most recently (my last two jobs) I requested advice from my boss at the time and it was truly valuable. 

## Pre-Interview (filtering stages)

### Rejection
Ask for feedback and take that into account when applying for other roles. Thank them for their time and remind yourself that this rejection means "not right now". After a cooling off period (roughly one month) you can apply again. 

On the second application, highlight what you've done over that month. E.g. learning two new languages, building 3-4 full stack applications, working on 1-2 open source (or real world) applications. 

Why? This highlights that you don't give up when people say no (most of my blocked JIRAs are due to teams/people saying no - but we persist until an agreement is reached). As this shows the employer you can handle receiving feedback and learn quickly. 

### Sorry, we're looking for people with experience

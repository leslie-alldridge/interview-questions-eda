# A brainstorm of job application tips and blockers

## Before applying

Ask yourself: Is this a job or an opportunity? If you answered job, I suggest applying for something else you're passionate about that will challenge you. Stretch further and reach higher so your mind is thinking along the lines of "how insane would it be if I got that job, I'd learn so much and it'd change my life." 

As tough or awkward as it may be, send your CV and cover letter example to 2-3 friends for feedback. You don't need to implement everything they suggest, but at least ask why and understand their point of view. 

Personally I was hesitant to share it with friends and colleagues, but after seeing the value it provides, this is now part of my job application ritual. Most recently (my last two jobs) I requested advice from my boss at the time and it was truly valuable. 

## Pre-Interview (filtering stages)

### Rejection

Ask for feedback and take that into account when applying for other roles. Thank them for their time and remind yourself that this rejection means "not right now". After a cooling off period (roughly one month) you can apply again. 

On the second application, highlight what you've done over that month. E.g. learning two new languages, building 3-4 full stack applications, working on 1-2 open source (or real world) applications. 

Why? This highlights that you don't give up when people say no (most of my blocked JIRAs are due to teams/people saying no - but we persist until an agreement is reached). As this shows the employer you can handle receiving feedback and learn quickly. 

### Sorry, we're looking for people with experience

If you have workplace experience then that is relevant / not relevant it would be ideal to ask for feedback. There is a high chance that the skills you learned and tasks undertaken in those roles wasn't appropriate or highlighted correctly. 

E.g. Salesperson applying for a Developer Role
1) I sold items at Dick Smith and was the top salesperson every month
2) Collaborated with a motivated team and constantly achieved sales goals set by regional management

The second one is much better as it focuses on teamwork (an integral part of being a developer). The first one is probably suited towards a sales / commission based role where making money is the main focus. 

If you don't have any work experience and constantly get caught out in interviews, you can:
1) Work on open source projects and collaborate on GitHub issues - highlight these in your interview / portfolio
2) Create real world projects (websites for local businesses / family / friends)
3) Diversify your experience across multiple languages (master one first, then branch out)
4) Ask the business what their stack is, create an application they will be interested in and show it in your interview. DON'T do a product demo, but rather demonstrate your learnings and knowledge of the stack. 

E.g. if you apply at TradeMe, make a new bidding feature, redesign featured listings, etc. Xero? Create a tool that solves a problem for small businesses. Flux? Make a mobile app focusing on power costs and plans. 

### Received a phone interview / first interview?

The following day before 9am send a message to thank them for their time. If you found a common ground - leverage that. E.g. "Thanks for your time the other day. It was great to hear about the exponential growth that the company is experiencing and I hope your cat is recovering from the recent fight." 

This reminds them that you exist and is considered standard etiquette.

### Prep for the interview
* Have you built an application relevant to the business?
* Has the employer actually viewed your online portfolio? Do you even have one?
* Who else is applying, what do they have that you might not have? Can you change this?
* What is the strategy and core values for the business you're applying to?
* Have you researched your interviewer and did they view your LinkedIn recently?
* Is your preparation complete? common questions, technical testing, etc
* What questions have you prepared (PLEASE don't ask about salary or other bog standard questions such as "what is a day in the life of a developer look like?" "what keeps you showing up to work?" "what is the team like?")
* Why not ask the above questions? They're boring and you won't stand out from other applicants. 

Try asking things like "what is a recent challenge the team have overcome?" "is there a budget for team building activities?" "will there be learning material and support in place when a new technology is required?"
